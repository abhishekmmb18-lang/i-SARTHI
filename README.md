## 📖 Overview
**I-SARTHI** is a comprehensive, AI-powered road safety system designed to prevent accidents and ensure rapid response in emergencies. By integrating **Computer Vision, IoT Sensors, and a centralized Database**, it monitors driver behavior, vehicle status, and road conditions in real-time.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 1. **Driver Monitoring System (DMS)** 😴
*   **Real-time Drowsiness Detection**: Uses OpenCV & Python to track eye closure ratios. 
*   **Instant Alerts**: Triggers loud alarms and voice warnings when fatigue is detected.
*   **Automatic SOS**: If drowsiness persists (10+ events), an automatic SOS SMS with GPS location is sent to emergency contacts.

### 2. **Smart Sensor Suite** 📡
*   **Alcohol Detection**: MQ-3 sensor prevents drunk driving by monitoring cabin air quality.
*   **Accident Detection**: Vibration sensors (MPU6050) detect impacts and crash forces.
*   **Blind Spot Monitoring**: Ultrasonic/Radar sensors warn of obstacles.
*   **Live GPS Tracking**: Real-time location logging for fleet management.

### 3. **Centralized Database Dashboard** 📊
*   **Secure Cloud/Local Storage**: All data (incidents, sensor logs, user profiles) is stored in a robust **SQLite Database**.
*   **Government/Admin Panel**: A dedicated "Database" dashboard for authorities to view:
    *   registered users.
    *   history of drowsiness events.
    *   black-box sensor logs (Speed, Location, Alcohol levels).
*   **Data Export**: Download comprehensive JSON reports for forensic analysis.
